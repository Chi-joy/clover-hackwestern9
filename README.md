## What is Clover?

Clover is lightweight Chrome extension designed to accompany a user during their work day, working to maintain the user's physical and mental health in a remote work from home environment whilst letting them focus on their work with its toolkit of scientifically proven techniques.

Users can input their work schedules into the extension and Clover will then compute their working times and schedule, generating intervals of work and rest that are optimized to increase focus and productivity. Clover then adapts to the user's work schedule, prompting them to interact with the app as they start and progress through their work day. 

Clover also uses a toolkit of health related widgets to keep users healthy and happy as they work. Users interact with widgets inside the Clover UI that encourage them to hydrate, fix their posture, and rest their eyes in set scientifically proven internvals. 

Clover's UI and tools are designed with specific scientific intent; Clover primarily utilizes the scientifically proven [Pomodoro productivity technique](https://science.nichd.nih.gov/confluence/display/newsletter/2020/05/07/The+Pomodoro+Technique%3A+An+Effective+Time+Management+Tool) to help users maintain focus in a potentially distracting environment. Clover utilizes other research such as the [20-20-20 rule](https://opto.ca/eye-health-library/20-20-20-rule) for eye strain reduction or widget interactions encouraging users to perform specified tasks via a [joint commitment action](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4700132) when clicking the UI. Green and cream colors were chosen to encourage relaxation in tandem with sharper colors like black and white being dulled, and the UI kept minimal and readable to reduce stress from visual clutter. 

## How do you use Clover?

After installing the extension via the Chrome extension store, users first input their week's work schedule into the extension. Then, when their work is about to begin, Clover will send them a notification, click on which will bring users to the main UI. 

When their work period starts, the user hits the "Start" button on the UI, converting it into a timer that tracks their periods of work and rest. To psychologically reinforce the seperation of work and rest, Clover converts the timer into "Rest" and "Resume" buttons for the user to click when their work or rest intervals end, sending a notification to the user. The user must then click the button restore the timer and show the remaining time of each interval. 

Clover currently has 3 independent widgets below the timer that track the time before a user should adjust their posture, hydrate, or rest their eyes. Unlike the timer these widgets progress from 100% to 0%, at which point Clover sends a notification to the user, encouraging them to perform the suggested action and then clicking the icon to reset the tracker back to 100%. 

Clicking the Exit icon will exit the app, and clicking the gear icon will bring up the Schedule tab in case you need to edit your schedule. 

## Why did we develop Clover?

With the permanent embedding of remote work as an alternative to in person attendance following the COVID-19 pandemic (especially in the technology industry), we wanted to develop a something that could benefit those struggling to adapt or getting introduced to this new space, as well as raise awareness of these issues regardless if they choose to use Clover or not. While there are many apps that encourage productivity with similar design intent, we noticed that health related features were not present, and their functionalities weren't tailored to support a work from home demographic. 

As many of us have probably experienced over the past few years, mental and physical health can degrade silently and quickly if left unchecked in a solitary work from home environment especially when it's exacerbated by the homogenization of work and personal life, making it difficult to remain productive and happy. We hope that Clover can provide assistance to those struggling to navigate this new yet unfamiliar environment, and if not, at least raise enough awareness for even a single person to reflect on their own work at home experiences and strive towards positive change.
